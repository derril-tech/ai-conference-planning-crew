## LangGraph Orchestration

### Workflow Structure
```python
from langgraph import StateGraph, END

# Define state schema
class ConferenceState(TypedDict):
    event_id: str
    brief: dict
    venue_shortlist: List[dict]
    speakers: List[dict]
    sponsors: List[dict]
    budget: dict
    marketing_plan: dict
    logistics_plan: dict
    risk_assessment: dict
    approvals: List[dict]

# Create workflow graph
workflow = StateGraph(ConferenceState)

# Add nodes for each agent
workflow.add_node("venue_scout", venue_scout_agent)
workflow.add_node("speaker_outreach", speaker_outreach_agent)
workflow.add_node("sponsorship_manager", sponsorship_manager_agent)
# ... other agents

# Define edges and approval gates
workflow.add_edge("venue_scout", "approval_gate")
workflow.add_conditional_edges("approval_gate", approval_router)
